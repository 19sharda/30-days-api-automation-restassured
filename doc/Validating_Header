ðŸš€ Day 11: Validating Response Headers

1. What are we doing today?
Weâ€™re going to validate response headers. Headers provide essential information about the response, such as the content type and cache policy.

ðŸ’¡Example: Think of response headers like the packaging of an item. It tells you whether itâ€™s fragile, the expiry date, or how to store it.

2. Code for Implementation

public class Validating_Header {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        baseURI = "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com";
        given()
                .when()
                .get("/posts/1")
                .then()
                .log().headers()
                .statusCode(200)
                .header("Content-Type", "application/json; charset=utf-8")
                .header("Cache-Control", "no-cache");
    }
}

3. Practice Questions
1. Extract and validate the Content-Type and Cache-Control headers from an API response.
2. Check for the presence of authentication-related headers like Authorization.
3. Test for any unexpected or missing headers in the response.

4. Whatâ€™s Next?
Tomorrow, weâ€™ll explore response time validation and ensure that our API is performing within expected limits.
