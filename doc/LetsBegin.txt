### 🛠️ Day 1: Setting Up for Success
To start, ensure you have the right tools in place:
1. **Java**: Install the latest JDK ([Download here](https://lnkd.in/gnU48a2A)).
2. **IDE**: Choose IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.
3. **Maven**: Set up Maven ([Guide here](https://lnkd.in/gxQ5Rwk6)).
4. **Rest Assured**: Add it as a dependency in your Maven project.

Here’s a quick program to test your setup:

```java
import io.restassured.RestAssured;
import io.restassured.response.Response;

public class APITest {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
 Response response = RestAssured.get("https://lnkd.in/gRN3y5UK");
 System.out.println("Status Code: " + response.getStatusCode());
 System.out.println("Response Body: " + response.getBody().asString());
 }
}
```

Run this code to verify that everything is working smoothly!
