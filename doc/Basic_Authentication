ðŸš€ Day 10: Automating Basic Authentication



1. What are we doing today?

Today, weâ€™ll tackle Basic Authentication. Many APIs require authentication before you can access data. Basic Authentication involves passing a username and password encoded in the request header.



ðŸ’¡Example: Just like how you need a key to enter a locked room, Basic Authentication uses a username and password to grant access to restricted areas in an API.

2. Code for Implementation



public class Basic_Authentication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        given()

                .auth()

                .basic("username", "password")

                .when()

                .get("https://httpbin.org/basic-auth/username/password")

                .then()

                .log().all()

                .statusCode(200);

    }

}

3. Practice Questions

1. Write a test case to access a secured API using Basic Authentication.

2. Try sending incorrect credentials and check for a 401 Unauthorized response.

3. Validate that the correct status code and message are returned.

4. Whatâ€™s Next?

Tomorrow, weâ€™ll learn how to validate response headers for API responses.
