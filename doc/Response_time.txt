ðŸš€ Day 13: Testing Response Time

 1. What are we doing today?
Today, we will focus on testing the response time of API requests. Slow response times can indicate issues with server performance.

ðŸ’¡ Laymanâ€™s Example: Imagine waiting for a webpage to load. If it takes too long, it can be frustrating, just like how long API response times can affect the user experience.

 2. Code for Implementation

java
given()
.when()
    .get("/posts/1")
.then()
    .time(lessThan(2000L)); // Ensure response time is under 2 seconds


---

 3. Practice Questions
1. Validate the response time for different API endpoints.
2. Ensure that the response time stays under a certain threshold (e.g., 3 seconds).
3. Compare response times between different API endpoints and identify potential performance bottlenecks.

 4. Whatâ€™s Next?
Tomorrow, weâ€™ll cover data-driven testing using TestNG, so we can reuse test data across multiple test cases.
