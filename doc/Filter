ðŸš€ Day 16: Using Filters for Debugging

1. What are we doing today?  
Weâ€™ll use filters in Rest Assured to log and debug requests and responses. Filters help us track API calls, making it easier to troubleshoot.

ðŸ’¡Example: Filters are like surveillance cameras in a store, recording everything that happens in the store. You can review the footage (logs) later if something goes wrong.

2. Code for Implementation
public class Filter {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        baseURI = "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com";
        given()
                .filter(new RequestLoggingFilter())  // Logs requests
                .filter(new ResponseLoggingFilter()) // Logs responses
                .when()
                .get("/posts/1")
                .then()
                .statusCode(200);

    }
}

3. Practice Questions  
1. Log both requests and responses for your test cases.  
2. Create custom filters to add additional information to logs.  
3. Analyze logs to identify potential issues or performance bottlenecks.

4. Whatâ€™s Next?  
Tomorrow, weâ€™ll explore handling JSON and XML response formats in API testing.
