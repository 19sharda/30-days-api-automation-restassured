### *ðŸš€ Day 6: Automating DELETE Requests*

#### *1. What are we doing today?*
Today, weâ€™ll delete resources using DELETE requests and validate their removal.

ðŸ’¡ *Laymanâ€™s Example:* Think of deleting an unwanted email from your inbox.

---

#### *2. Code for Implementation*

//java
// DELETE Request: Remove the resource
public class Delete {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        baseURI = "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com";
        given()
                .when()
                .delete("/posts/1")
                .then()
                .log().all()
                .statusCode(200); // Or 204 for successful deletion


    }
}

#### *3. Practice Questions*
1. Delete a specific post using the DELETE method.
2. Attempt to delete the same post again and validate the response (it should return 404).
3. Verify the post no longer exists by performing a GET request.

#### *4. Whatâ€™s Next?*
Tomorrow, weâ€™ll extract and validate data from JSON responses using *JSONPath*.
